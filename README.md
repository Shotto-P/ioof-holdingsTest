- In the app, you can place multiple robots on the specific ranged table.
- When you place a robot, the active robot will automatically become the one placed just now.
- You can switch the active robot by entering ROBOT number. e.g. ROBOT 1, to switch to robot 1
- When you are trying to move a robot outside the range, it will ask you to try again without processing any movement
- Everytime you enter the REPORT command, the program will return you back the summary of the robots, and end the game.
